# Budget_Tracker
Utilizing a budget tracker can be extremely beneficial for monitoring your earnings and expenditures.


The budget tracker that we are about to develop comprises various crucial elements, including a user interface, input forms, local storage, and calculation logic. To design and style the budget tracker's user interface, we will use HTML and CSS.

To enable users to enter their income and expenses, we will employ HTML forms. For storing user budget data, we will use a browser's local storage. Finally, we will use JavaScript to compute the user's total income, expenses, and budget balance. 

In corporating these fundamental components will result in a fully functional budget tracker that enables users to effortlessly input, store, and view their budget information.
